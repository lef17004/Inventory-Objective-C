#  Objective-C Class Test

## Overview
I have never programmed in Objective-C before, so I made this program to learn how classes work in this language. I have a simple class called inventory I created to experiment with. 

## Development Envirnment
I created this using Xcode version 12.1. To set up this project, first install Xcode if you don't have it already. Then go to Source Control->Clone and then paste in the link to this Github repository. The project should download and be setup automatically.
